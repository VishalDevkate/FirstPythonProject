Exit code 5 in pytest means that no tests were collected. This can happen if there are no tests in the specified directory or if the tests are not named correctly 1. To fix this, you can try calling pytest.exit(). If you are running various kinds of files through pre-commit or using hooks before you commit, youâ€™ll need to add another parameter to the .pre-commit-config.yaml file or it will fail with an exit code of 5.
